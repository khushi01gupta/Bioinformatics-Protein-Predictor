APOE SNP Analyzer for Personalized Medicine
Project Overview
This is a concise Python tool that simulates personalized genetic risk analysis by examining a patient's genotype for a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) associated with Alzheimer's disease risk.

The project demonstrates core bioinformatics skills in diagnostic interpretation and conditional logic applied to human genetic data.

Core Genetic Principle: APOE Gene Risk

The analysis focuses on the APOE gene (rs429358), which determines the APOE ϵ4 allele presence. The ϵ4 allele is strongly linked to an increased lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

Genotype

Alleles

Estimated Risk

Interpretation

E4/E4

Two Cysteine alleles (CC)

Significantly Increased Risk

Highest risk level.

E3/E4

One Threonine (T), one Cysteine (C)

Increased Risk

Elevated risk compared to general population.

E3/E3

Two Threonine alleles (TT)

Typical Population Risk

Baseline risk.

Execution and Setup
Requirements

The project only requires standard Python 3.

How to Run the Analyzer

You can modify the patient_input variable in the main() function to test different genotypes ('TT', 'TC', or 'CC').

Gene Locus Analyzed: APOE (rs429358)
Genotype Input: TC
Alleles Found: Allele 1: T, Allele 2: C

--- Risk Assessment ---
APOE Genotype: E3/E4 (Threonine/Cysteine)
Estimated Risk: Increased Risk

Note: The presence of one E4 (Cysteine) allele increases lifetime risk compared to E3/E3.
