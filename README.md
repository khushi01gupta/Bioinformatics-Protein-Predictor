Protein Function Prediction Tool (Python/Bioinformatics)
üß¨ Project Overview
This project is a concise, self-contained Python application designed to predict the molecular function of an unknown protein sequence. It demonstrates fundamental bioinformatics skills by combining sequence similarity analysis and protein domain motif recognition.

The project is built around the classic example of Human Src Kinase (P12931), a well-characterized signaling protein, and is structured to showcase analytical reasoning and technical proficiency in Python.

Core Bioinformatics Principles Demonstrated:

Homology Inference: Using known sequence similarity (BLAST results) to infer function based on evolutionary relatedness.

Domain Architecture Analysis: Identifying key functional modules (motifs) within the sequence that dictate the protein's biochemical capabilities (e.g., ATP-binding, regulatory function).

Computational Efficiency: Handling and parsing structured biological data (XML) entirely within a Python environment.

üöÄ Analysis Output (Example Report)
Running the script produces a clear, structured report in the terminal:

==================================================

(and 2 more high-similarity hits...)

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Execution
Requirements

The project only requires Python 3 and the Biopython library.

Install Biopython:

pip install biopython

How to Run

The script is designed to run directly without external files, as the protein sequence and simulated BLAST results are embedded within the main() function for robustness.

python bioinfo\ project.py

Step 2: Push the Changes to GitHub

After you have saved the file, run these three commands exactly in order in your terminal (you are already in the correct Bioinformatics-Project folder):

# 1. Stage the new file (this MUST work now)
git add README.md

# 2. Commit the new file
git commit -m "Add final detailed README documentation"

# 3. Push the commit to GitHub
git push
